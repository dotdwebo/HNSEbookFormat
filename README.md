# Handshake-Project-Design-Notes
Ebook Format for Handshake's Project Design Notes.
Original Text could be checked on https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.

Background:
This ebook format was created to help readers who want to read Project Design Notes in PDF and ODT format. 
Anyone can download, upload, or redesign the layout (permissionlessly).

For your information:
- The contents of these Project Design Notes remain as they were originally. (I am not the original author. Best regards to the author)
- I added numbering and sub-numbering to each topic to make categorization easier.
- I added a cover to increase brand awareness of the Handshake community. I got the logo on the cover from the https://handshake.org website.
- I added a table of contents to help us see the big picture of the topics covered and hyperlinks to make it easier to find the desired topic.
