# Handshake-Project-Design-Notes
Ebook Format for Handshake's Project Design Notes.
Original Text could be checked on https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.
This ebook format was created to help readers who want to read Project Design Notes in PDF and ODT format. Anyone can download or redesign the format.
For your information:
- The contents of these Project Design Notes remain as they were originally.
- I added points and subpoints to each topic to make categorization easier.
- I added a cover to increase brand awareness of the Handshake community. I got the logo listed on the cover from the handshake.org website.
- I added a table of contents to help us see the big picture of the topics covered and to make it easier to find the desired topic.
